                <h2>What is Six Sigma?</h2>
                <p>Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology for process improvement and quality management, aiming to reduce defects and variability in business processes. Developed by Motorola in the 1980s, it uses statistical tools and techniques to identify and eliminate root causes of errors, targeting near-perfection (3.4 defects per million opportunities). It emphasizes DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) for problem-solving and relies on trained professionals (e.g., Green Belts, Black Belts) to implement projects. Widely used across industries, Six Sigma enhances efficiency, reduces costs, and improves customer satisfaction.</p>

                <h2>DMAIC Methodology</h2>
                <p>Six Sigma is grounded in the DMAIC methodology. The name 'DMAIC' is an acronym for the five phases which comprise the methodology. I'll go through each briefly.</p>
                <h3>1. Define</h3>
                <p>Set project goals and boundaries in alignment with your organizations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Business Goals.</li>
                    <li>Customer Needs.</li>
                    <li>The process that requires improvement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Measure</h3>
                <p>Pinpoint the location/ source of problems by building a factual understanding of the existing process conditions. Also, establish a baseline capability level.</p>
                <h3>3. Analyze</h3>
                <p>Develop theories of root causes based on information from the 'measure' phase. Confirm theories with data and identify root causes of the problem.</p>
                <h3>4. Improve</h3>
                <p>Develop, implement, and evaluate solutions targeted at the verified cause. The goal is to prove with data that your solution(s) solves the problem and leads to an improvement.</p>
                <h3>5. Control</h3>
                <p>Concentrate on ensuring the problem stays fixed & new methods can be further improved over time.</p>

                        <h4>Bill Smith:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Motorola introduced six sigma as a measure of quality in 1986.</li>
                            <li>Smith, with Mikel Harry, developed the initial four-step six sigma stages: measure, analyze, control to reduce defect levels.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Mikel Harry:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continued work from Motorola with Richard Schroeder, and founded Six Sigma Academy in 1994.</li>
                            <li>He's the main architect of the six sigma movement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Crosby:</h4>
                        <p>He came up with his 'four absolutes'</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The definition of quality is conformance to requirements</li>
                            <li>The system of quality is prevention</li>
                            <li>The performance standard is zero defects</li>
                            <li>The measurement of quality is the price of nonconformance</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>All in all, this goes to say: "Do it right the first time".</p>
                        <h4>Deming's 14 Points:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service. Innovate, allocate resources to long-term planning. Put resources into research and education.</li>
                            <li>Adopt a new philosophy. Do not tolerate commonly accepted levels of errors or defects.</li>
                            <li>Cease dependence on mass inspection to achieve quality. Inspection does not improve quality. Quality is build into a product and cannot be inspected into it.</li>
                            <li>End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag alone. Minimize total cost by working with a single supplier.</li>
                            <li>Improve constantly in ever process for planning, production, and service. Continually improve test methods and identify problems, from the very first planning stage right up to distribution to customers.</li>
                            <li>Institute training on the job. In Japan, managers start their careers with a long internship. They work in procurement, accounting, distribution, and sales.</li>
                            <li>Adopt and institute leadership. The job of management is not supervision, but leadership.</li>
                            <li>Drive out fear, No one can perform unless he or she feels secure.</li>
                            <li>Break down barriers between staff areas. Create teams of members coming from all areas and sectors of the business to prevent and solve problems.</li>
                            <li>Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the workforce.</li>
                            <li>Eliminate numerical quotas for the workforce and numerical goals for management.</li>
                            <li>Remove barriers that rob people of the pride of workmanship. Eliminate the annual rating or merit system.</li>
                            <li>Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement for everyone.</li>
                            <li>Put everyone in the company to work to accomplish the transformation.</li>
